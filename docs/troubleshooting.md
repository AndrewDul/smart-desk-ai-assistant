# Troubleshooting Log



## Issue 001 - USB microphone captures too much noise
**Date:** 2026-03-31  
**Area:** audio  
**Status:** partial  

**Problem**  
The connected USB microphone worked, but voice recognition was not stable.

**Symptoms**  
- assistant sometimes needed repeated commands
- background noise affected speech recognition
- recognition quality was inconsistent

**What I tested**  
- microphone connected and detected
- speaker output confirmed
- speech recognition tested with Vosk
- multiple spoken command attempts tested

**Root cause**  
The microphone appears to capture too much environmental noise and is not ideal for clean command recognition.

**Fix applied**  
No final hardware fix yet. Software recognition was improved enough to begin testing commands.

**Result**  
Voice commands work, but not as reliably as desired.

**Follow-up**  
Possible improvement:
- buy a better microphone or USB headset
- tune gain and microphone placement
- test grammar-restricted recognition mode again

## Issue 002 - OLED did not show output with earlier display module
**Date:** 2026-04-01  
**Area:** OLED / software  
**Status:** resolved  

**Problem**  
OLED was not showing output when the earlier animated display file was used.

**Symptoms**  
- OLED remained blank
- minimal display test worked
- larger display module version failed

**What I tested**  
- confirmed OLED worked with a shorter test display file
- compared working and non-working versions of `display.py`
- checked display initialization logic
- replaced the OLED import and simplified drawing logic

**Root cause**  
The previous display implementation was less reliable. The working version used a simpler initialization path and a simpler rendering approach.

**Fix applied**  
`display.py` was rebuilt on top of the working OLED initialization and then extended again with safer animation logic.

**Result**  
OLED output worked again and could be extended back toward animated display behaviour.

**Follow-up**  
If OLED issues return later:
- test with a minimal OLED text screen first
- confirm I2C device detection
- confirm the exact OLED driver class

## Issue 003 - Voice recognition test failed because Python could not import modules
**Date:** 2026-04-01  
**Area:** software / project structure  
**Status:** resolved  

**Problem**  
The voice recognition test file failed with a module import error.

**Symptoms**  
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modules'`

**What I tested**  
- confirmed working directory
- added `__init__.py` files
- launched the test using module mode instead of direct file execution

**Root cause**  
The test was launched in a way that did not correctly treat the project structure as a package.

**Fix applied**  
Used:
- `touch modules/__init__.py`
- `touch tests/__init__.py`
- `python -m tests.test_voice_commands`

**Result**  
The test loaded correctly and Vosk initialized.

**Follow-up**  
Keep test execution consistent and package-aware.

## Issue 004 - OLED animation and text overlay need continued tuning
**Date:** 2026-04-01  
**Area:** OLED / UX  
**Status:** open  

**Problem**  
The OLED now works, but the display behaviour still needs polish.

**Symptoms**  
- eye shape and motion may still need refinement
- animation timing may need adjustment
- text overlays should remain readable and then cleanly return to idle eyes

**What I tested**  
- simple OLED text output
- animated idle mode
- menu/status overlays with timed return

**Root cause**  
This is not a fault anymore, but an expected refinement stage.

**Fix applied**  
Current display module supports both animation and text overlays.

**Result**  
The OLED is now usable for both assistant animation and temporary information screens.

**Follow-up**  
Improve:
- eye design
- blink behaviour
- expression variety
- menu readability
